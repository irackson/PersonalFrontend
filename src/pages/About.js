                <h3>When were you first exposed to user experience design?</h3>
                <h4>
                    <p>
                        I was first exposed to user experience design in the
                        backseat of a car headed for Cooper’s Beach at the age
                        of 6. The first iPod had just come out and my friend
                        handed me one earphone to share a listening experience
                        unlike anything I could have imagined. The notion that I
                        could digitize our family CD collection and carry it
                        everywhere I went changed my world. I was immediately
                        inspired to start a CD ripping business, and within the
                        year had been written up in Forbes magazine for being a
                        young entrepreneur.

                    <p>
                        I took my first programming class in freshman year of
                        highschool. After learning the basics of web design I
                        taught middle-schoolers at multiple youth development
                        programs throughout the rest of my time in highschool.
                        I’m not sure what first sparked my interest in coding as
                        a career, but I do know that my senior yearbook quote
                        was about becoming a software engineer.

                <h3>Why are you passionate about this work?</h3>
                <h4>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about software engineering because I
                        love that coding is a contract for continuous lifelong
                        learning. In almost every other field, the more time you
                        spend practicing, the closer you get to mastering the
                        skills you once set out to learn. With programming, the
                        target is always moving. You have to keep up with the
                        young guys who are learning the latest technologies.
                        Getting better always means learning new things, as
                        opposed to working towards a goal and then comfortably
                        sitting with that expert base of knowledge for the rest
                        of your life.

                        I’m an exceptional creative problem solver. My code
                        almost always has some hacky fix to a problem that
                        someone with a deeper knowledge of the language could
                        probably solve in one line; but despite not knowing
                        every shortcut in the book I still manage to get the
                        computer to do what I want it to do.

                        When creativity fails me or I want to refactor at some

                        determination to succeed takes over and I use another
                        great talent of mine, resourcefulness, to seek out
                        answers. I’m an expert at researching the web, which is
                        actually a skill I honed throughout my time at an elite
                        highschool, the University of Chicago, and NYU.

                        After graduating from GA’s bootcamp, I want to get a

                        believe this experience has prepared me for a career in
                        software development, where bugs often come up right
                        before deadlines, and the ability to collaborate despite

                        Working as a research analyst in finance helped teach me
                        how to ask the right questions. I spent most of my time
                        going through decks and deciding if they were worth
                        presenting to the higher-ups as viable investment

                        develop my critical thinking and research skills. What
                        this means for a hiring manager looking at my
                        application is that I’m not just valuable as a cog in
                        the deployment machine. I’m also capable of contributing
                        to the analysis of the potential value of implementing a
                        new feature before being tasked with making it come to

                        Whist working as a research analyst, I was once tasked
                        with reviewing an opportunity to invest in a crypto
                        fund. My due diligence led me to the conclusion that our
                        money would be unsafe with Virgil Capital based on their
                        returns seeming way too high for the space they were
                        occupying, amongst a number of other factors. My boss
                        trusted my gut instinct and decided not to advise
                        clients to invest. Just the other day, he reached out to
                        me with a link to this article. It turns out I saved a
                        bunch of people a bunch of money with that pass.

                        analysis, and learning to make some delicious drinks at
                        the juice shop, my main professional accomplishments
                        came from my time as a professional student. Getting
                        into the University of Chicago and being accepted for
                        transfer to NYU were difficult feats that required years
                        of continuous dedication to achieving academic
                        excellence. Though I never completed a degree, in my
                        first year at UChicago I earned an almost perfect GPA.
                        And though I never completed a semester at NYU after
                        transferring, I do considerate the knowledge and
                        experience that I accumulated over my short time there
                        to be a significant achievement.

                        turned to me for help learning a valuable skill, and

                        learning how to program has pushed me far ahead of the
                        curriculum. Multiple peers come to me for tutoring when

                        to help and extremely patient. I always go out of my way
                        to make sure they not only get the correct answer, but
                        also learn how to arrive at correct answers themselves
